---Deep linking----

A deeplink is a special url that is associated with an app. When a user tries to open this url, iOS recognizes that this link is a deeplink, and will try to open the app associated with the link.

UIApplication.shared.open(url) is the most common method but can be restricted in app extensions like iMessage extensions. App extensions are not allowed to open URLs directly

"'shared' is unavailable in application extensions for iOS: Use view controller based solutions where appropriate instead."
