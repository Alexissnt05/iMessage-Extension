Deep Linking
A deep link is a unique URL linked to a specific app. When a user attempts to access this URL, iOS identifies it as a deep link and tries to launch the corresponding app.

The most commonly used method for opening a URL is UIApplication.shared.open(url). However, this approach is restricted in certain app extensions, such as iMessage extensions, as they are not permitted to open URLs directly.

In such cases, attempting to use UIApplication.shared may result in an error stating:
"'shared' is unavailable in application extensions for iOS: Use view controller-based solutions where appropriate instead."
